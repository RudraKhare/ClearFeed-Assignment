            "{'title': 'Child Accounts', 'text': '# Child Accounts\\n\\nExplore how to create and manage multiple ClearFeed accounts\\n\\nOne ClearFeed Account (Parent or Child Account) is linked to one [Product\\nEdition](/clearfeed-help-center/account-settings/product-editions) \\\\- External\\nHelpdesk, Internal Helpdesk, or Internal Helpdesk (Integrations). The 3\\ndifferent product editions have different\\n[pricing](https://clearfeed.ai/pricing) models.\\n\\nOne ClearFeed Account (Parent or Child Account) can be integrated with only\\none Slack or Teams workspace. Integrations with Zendesk and other\\nticketing/issue management systems can be shared between 2 ClearFeed Accounts.\\n\\nIf you have 2 different accounts (one parent and one child) with different\\nproduct editions, you will receive 2 different invoices from ClearFeed.\\n\\nEach ClearFeed account (Parent or Child Account) has its own set of users for\\nadmins to maintain data access and privacy.\\n\\n##\\n\\nUsecase\\n\\nCreating a child account is advisable in the following scenarios:\\n\\n  * Integrate ClearFeed with multiple Slack workspaces\\n\\n  * Integrated ClearFeed with Slack and MS Teams workspaces\\n\\n  * Integrate multiple domains from your ticketing system into the same Slack workspace.\\n\\n  * Currently using ClearFeed as an External Helpdesk, and want to start using ClearFeed as an Internal Helpdesk (and vice-versa). \\n\\n  * Currently using ClearFeed as an Internal Helpdesk, and want to start using ClearFeed for Integrations (and vice-versa). \\n\\n  * For internal helpdesk support - creating multiple accounts can be helpful to isolate work across different teams if you don\\'t want tickets on one account to be visible to users from another account.\\n\\nTo create additional ClearFeed accounts, **you need to be an Admin in the\\nprimary account. This is mandatory.**\\n\\n##\\n\\nCreate child accounts\\n\\n  1. Navigate to your profile icon at the bottom-left corner\\n\\n  2. Click on `Create New Account`.\\n\\n  3. Enter a name for the new account.\\n\\n  4. Choose the required sharing option for this account:\\n\\n     * **Share Slack workspace with your account:** This allows you to connect with other ticketing integrations into the same Slack workspace (e.g. connect multiple Zendesk domains with this approach). \\n\\n     * **Share other integrations with your account:** Connect this account with a new Slack workspace but share the ticketing integrations with the primary account. \\n\\n       * E.g.: Connect different Slack workspaces with the same Intercom domain using this approach. \\n\\n     * **Share Slack workspace and all supported integrations with your account** : Connect your new account with the**** same Slack workspace and share the ticketing integrations with the primary account. \\n\\n       * E.g.: Connect existing Slack workspaces with the same Intercom domain using this approach. \\n\\n  5. Select [Product Edition](/clearfeed-help-center/account-settings/product-editions) for the child account setup \\n\\n###\\n\\nSwitch Accounts\\n\\nOnce you have created additional accounts, you can switch between the accounts\\nby simply hovering over the profile icon (bottom-left corner) and you will\\nnotice all the accounts. From there, click on the account you want to switch\\nto and you\\'ll be redirected to that account.\\n\\n##\\n\\nRename Accounts\\n\\nYou can rename your account name at any time on ClearFeed.\\n\\n##\\n\\nSharing Options\\n\\n###\\n\\n**Slack workspace**\\n\\n  * Connect your new ClearFeed account to the same Slack workspace as your primary account, sharing channels and conversations for seamless collaboration.\\n\\n  * Maintain independent integrations for your new account, separate from those of your primary account.\\n\\n  * Set unique SLA policies, business hours, users, and collections for your new account.\\n\\n###\\n\\nOther integrations\\n\\nOnly Zendesk, Intercom, and Atlassian are supported as shared integrations as\\nof now. If you want to request support for additional integrations, please\\nreach out to us via Slack or at support@clearfeed.ai.\\n\\n  * Create a new ClearFeed account to connect with a different Slack workspace sharing the same email domain as your primary account.\\n\\n  * Share integrations between your primary ClearFeed account and the new account across multiple Slack workspaces.\\n\\n  * Use the same integrations connected to your primary account across various Slack workspaces.\\n\\n  * The new account can set its own SLA policy, business hours, users, and collections.\\n\\n**Note** :\\n\\n  1. If an integration is shared, the child account cannot reconnect or delete it.\\n\\n  2. However, users are allowed to independently connect any other (non-shared) integration to a child account .\\n\\n  3. If any new ticketing integration is configured as shared, behavior #2 will apply.\\n\\n###\\n\\n**Slack workspace & **other integrations\\n\\nOnly Zendesk, Intercom, and Atlassian are supported as shared integrations as\\nof now. If you want to request support for additional integrations, please\\nreach out to us via Slack or at support@clearfeed.ai.\\n\\n  * By selecting this option, your new account will be linked to the same Slack workspace and use the same integrations as your primary account. \\n\\n  * Since multiple teams use Zendesk ticketing and forms, creating a child account with this configuration allows users to customize screen options for forms. For example, some teams might want to hide the \"Solve\" button, while others prefer to remove the \"View Form\" button.\\n\\n**Note** :\\n\\n  1. If an integration is shared, the child account cannot reconnect or delete it.\\n\\n  2. However, users are allowed to independently connect any other (non-shared) integration to a child account .\\n\\n  3. If any new ticketing integration is configured as shared, behavior #2 will apply.\\n\\n##\\n\\nRelationship with Primary Account\\n\\n###\\n\\nDependent\\n\\n  * The whitelisted bots are shared between primary and secondary account(s). That means, that when a new account is created, it carries forward the whitelisted bot configuration from the primary account. Any change in this configuration from any of the accounts (primary or secondary) will be reflected across all accounts.\\n\\n  * Whitelisted domains allow users from a list of domains to join the ClearFeed Account automatically. Only the admin user’s email domain is copied over to the child account. Any other whitelisted domains are not copied. Gmail is an exception and is never copied, even for admins. To whitelist more domains, users need to manually add them to the child accounts.\\n\\n  * If you choose to **share the integrations** and connect the new account to a different Slack workspace, then the integrations will be dependent on the primary account. You will be unable to reconnect or delete them from the new account.\\n\\n###\\n\\nIndependent\\n\\n  * Account-level settings such as SLAs, business hours, data retention, and user management are independent of the new account(s).\\n\\n  * Collection and channel management settings are independent and isolated for the new account.\\n\\n  * [Objects](/clearfeed-help-center/clearfeed-helpdesk/objects-fields-and-forms) (forms and fields), [Announcements](/clearfeed-help-center/clearfeed-helpdesk/announcements) and [Knowledge Sources](/clearfeed-help-center/answers/automated-answers) are independent and isolated for the new account.\\n\\n[PreviousCustomer Portal](/clearfeed-help-center/account-setup/customer-\\nportal)[NextLogin Methods](/clearfeed-help-center/account-setup/security-\\nsettings)\\n\\nLast updated 18 days ago\\n\\n'}\n"
